    // todo
    //  The course is coming to an end and I would like you to tell me how did it go
    //  *
    //  It was awesome. I feel like I've learned a LOT and even got inspired to do some other project that others
    //  will benefit too. I've met IntelliJ and Pycharm, cant even use other IDEs. I've learnt about git and also
    //  started using it on my own projects too.

    // todo A
    //  On the scale 1 to 10 how useless or useful this course was with 1 being very useless and 10 being very useful?
    //  *
    //  10 without a doubt.

    // todo B
    //  Write some things you liked? At least 1, but you can write more.
    //  *
    //  I like the way you're teaching a lot. Can say that I didnt get bored in any lessons.
    //  Felt like watching tutorials on YouTube(That was a compliment :) ).
    //

    // todo C
    //  Write some things you didn't like? At least 1, but you can write more.
    //
    //

    // todo D
    //  Anything else to add? Comments? What to do differently next year? (optional)
    //  *
    //  I liked that the videos were in parts, it was so easy to follow and find materials.
    //  I dont know how would it be if it wasn't for covid situations.
